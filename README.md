# ev-data-analysis
A data analytics project focused on understanding electric vehicle adoption using the Electric Vehicle Population dataset. This project involves data preprocessing, in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA), and meaningful visualizations to highlight patterns and trends in EV usage.
# Objectives
Understand the composition and growth of the EV population.
Visualize trends in EV adoption over time.
Examine the fuel types and electric ranges of different vehicle models.
Detect and handle missing, inconsistent, or duplicate records.
# Key Analysis Performed
Data Cleaning: Type conversion, null value handling, and deduplication.
Descriptive Statistics: Mean, median, mode, distributions, and correlations.
Top Brands and Models: Ranking based on popularity and growth.
Fuel Type Analysis: Comparison across Battery Electric, Plug-in Hybrid, etc.
Electric Range Evaluation: Assessing average and maximum range of EVs.
EV Range Comparison: Comparison of electric range by vehicle make, model year, and type.
#  Electric Range & Vehicle Type Analysis
A core focus of this project was to explore how electric range varies across different vehicle types, particularly Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs).
# Insights & Takeaways
A steady year-on-year increase in electric vehicle registrations.
Certain manufacturers (like Tesla, Nissan) dominate the EV space.
Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) are more prevalent than Plug-in Hybrids in recent years.
Newer models offer significantly higher electric ranges.
Battery Electric Vehicles generally have longer ranges than Plug-in Hybrids.
EV range has been increasing steadily with each new model year.
